Back End:
---------
- request to getUserBookings function returns empty array
- events that are updated are get a new entry instead of being updated
- error when creating a new booking -> line 106 in Booking.php --> foreach loop gets invalid arguments --> corrolation with other bookings is not checked
- when creating a new booking it is not checked if i enter an event name
- include status messages such as [[400]] => successful
								  [[500]] => failure
  as i did in the mb_updateBooking
